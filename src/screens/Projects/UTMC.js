            Over the course of this year, our team worked very hard on bringing the UTM Campus to the digital
            world of Minecraft. We started this project to help students "visit" campus during the COVID-19 pandemic
            when physical visitation may not be entirely possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were able to build Deerfield Hall (MC-DH) and Maanjiwe nendamowinan (MC-MN). We are looking to
            restart the project soon, and will have builder applications open soon!

        <h2>About this Project</h2>
        <p>
            Project UTMC is a student-run project to build the University of Toronto Mississauga campus on Minecraft
            that can be accessed by anyone and at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>But why? I could just visit the campus in-person… Well to provide some context…</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            On March 16, 2020, all in-person classes at the University of Toronto’s campuses were cancelled due to
            the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, all university buildings were closed to the general public the
            following day. Since then, many students are unable to return to campus during this time and graduating
            students were unable to see campus for possibly the last time during their study years. This provided us an
            opportunity to bring the campus experience virtually to students and faculty.
